## Overview
This repository contains code relevant to calculating phase behavior in supramolecular polymer systems. 

- ``oneComponent.py`` : Functions used to calculate structure factor for supramolecular polymers in solution based on the paper by [Balzer and Fredrickson, J. Chem. Phys. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0218748).
- ``example.py`` : Shows usage of ``oneComponent.py`` for discrete and continuous Gaussian chains.

## Usage
To generate plots in ``figures/``, run the example script as``python3 example.py``.
